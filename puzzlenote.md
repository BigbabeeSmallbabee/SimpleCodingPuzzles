# Note about the Puzzles

You know, for me, the most important thing, always, are the basics. 

In my experience as a tutor for more than 11 years (at the point of time when this repo was created), the biggest challenge for a lot of students is applying the coding concepts to actual software development. 

To me, the journey to software development is something like this.

1. learn the coding concepts
1. apply these coding concepts to practice with simple puzzles
1. apply these coding concepts to practice by building full fledged projects, small and big. 

The puzzles in this repository are a mix of many things. Majority of them are borrowed from other sources like MDN or free code camp or Project Odin. Sometimes, I randomly come up with puzzles as I go about my life as a coding tutor, generated puzzle ideas in my head. A lot of times, puzzles are simply remixes of earlier puzzles.

Whenever I am borrowing or directly inspired by an online source, I will aways put a link back or a reference. 

Ultimately, these puzzles are meant for beginners only. These are not meant to help you get a job or get high scores in coding competitions. my ambtion and purpose is not those things.

Rather, act as a helping hand for those who are struggling to find simple ways to apply what they are learning before moving on to more complex challenges ahead.
